The source code will be uploaded shortly. The recommended citation method for this work will be provided once its DOI is assigned (currently in process).

- Demo: https://taegonchung.github.io/elegansbot/
    - Use the sliders to observe the worm's movement changes
        - Water-Agar Slider: Adjust this to modify the ground's frictional coefficients.
        - Swim-Crawl Slider: This slider alters the period and linear wave number of C. elegans' locomotion.
